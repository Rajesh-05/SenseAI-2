Examples of organic acid producers are Aspergillus niger for citric acid, Acetobacter aceti for acetic acid, Rhizopus oryzae for fumaric acid, Clostridium butyricum for butyric acid and Lactobacillusfor lactic acid. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacteria are used for commercial production of enzymes. Lipases are used in detergent formulations and are used for removing oily stains from the laundry. Bottled juices are clarified by the use of pectinase,protease and cellulase. Rennet can also be used to separate milk into solid curds for cheese making. Streptokinase produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and genetically engineered Streptococci are used as \\u201cclot buster\\u201d for removing clots from the blood vessels of patients who have undergone myocardial infarction\")"
